        <p>As a college student, I understand how hard it can be to live on your own in your early 20s and be fully responsible for balancing classes, homework, a social life, and feeding yourself well. With such busy schedules, us college students don’t always have the time or the energy to come home and cook a healthy meal every day. We are surrounded by takeout options and have fast food ordering at our fingertips, which on top of not providing the healthiest options can also get expensive if relied upon frequently.<br><br>
            I’ve spent a lot of time throughout my college career searching the internet for healthy, affordable, great-tasting meal prep recipes that would get me through a busy week while still making me feel good about what I’m putting into my body. My goal is to share those recipes with you in hopes of giving you the tools you need to feel confident in taking care of your body’s nutritional needs.<br><br>
            Happy cooking!<br><br>
            - Erica
