    My name is Erica Legaard, and I am a Photography and Information Management & Technology dual major. I am interested in pursuing career fields related to visual communications and design, web development, and user experience. My technical skills include photography, graphic design, copy editing, and visual editing. I have experience with Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office Suite, and Python. Outside of school, my hobbies include dancing, cooking, and reading. My favorite TV show is Survivor, my favorite movies are the Lord of the Rings trilogy movies, and my most recent favorite book is Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens. I am from a family of six, with two sisters and one brother. I have been a life-long Catholic but am currently studying scripture in another Christian church.
